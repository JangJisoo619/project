# Project(Image Captioning)

Objective: Build a model that generates descriptive captions for images.

Approach:
Use a dataset like MS COCO, which provides images with captions.
Implement a CNN to extract image features and an RNN (LSTM or GRU) to generate captions.
Train the model on the dataset, fine-tuning it for accuracy.
Evaluate the captions using BLEU scores and qualitative analysis.
Optionally, add attention mechanisms to improve caption quality.
